# CIS2055 - Web Application Architecture and Systems Development

## Project: Web Application NEMESYS – Near Miss Exposure and Reporting System
Near-miss reports are intended for administrative bodies at UoM (e.g. student bodies, precincts office etc...)
on which action can then be taken to improve the overall Health and Safety conditions on campus.

## 1. Migrations
This project was programmed on MacOS which does not support SQL Server by
default. SQL Server was provided via Docker so the appsettings.json may be
different because of the trusted connection setting. See the "appsettings.json"
file for more information.

### 1.1 Package Manager Console
`Update-Database`
